# K Nearest Neighbors
KNN algorithm implementation using numpy, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib etc. to find optimum K-value. 
The KNN implementation is done on a data-set for missing-features containing random data with Target Class.

This repository will help in understanding the implementation of KNN on data-set containing missing features and only target classes. It will also help in understanding the analysis behind error_rate Vs K value by means of graph plotting through data-visualization libraries like Matplotlib, seaborn etc..

Please refer to link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-nearest_neighbors_algorithm for more details on KNN.
